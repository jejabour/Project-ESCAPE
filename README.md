# Project ESCAPE Scenarios

The files contained in this repo are Scenario files used in Empty Empsilon for Project ESCAPE

The initial work for this was done by Brandon Randle. I have been modifying and creating some of my own work based on his.

To play these scenarios, drop the scenario files into the scripts folder (root of Empty Epsilon/scripts/) of your Empty Epsilon install, and they will appear in the Scenario Selection portion.
